## Guidelines for Using This Template

### What Executives Care About

1. **Are we secure enough?** Overall posture assessment
2. **What are the big risks?** Top concerns they should know about
3. **Are we making progress?** Roadmap and initiative status
4. **Do you need anything from us?** Decisions, resources, support
5. **What happened?** Incidents and near-misses

### What to Avoid

- Technical jargon without business context
- Metrics without interpretation
- Long lists of activities (focus on outcomes)
- Burying bad news
- Asking for decisions without recommendations

### Presentation Tips

- Lead with the headline (good news or bad)
- Be prepared to go deeper on any section
- Have backup data ready but don't present it all
- End with clear asks
- Keep it under 15 minutes for verbal presentation
